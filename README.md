### Restaurant Recommendation (Using Decision Trees)

A crowdsourced restaurant recommendation system that filters out a restaurant from a myriad of
preset ones purely based on the user preferences after a series of dichotomous questions
explicitly designed to target specifically what the user desires. The decision tree will use Cuisine
Preferred, Pricing, Time of the day, and Current Rating, and if required, based on time and other
factors, we may also include the users' preferred area to further filter the restaurant out.

### Proposed Methodology
1. Accumulation of enough data using arrays, files, or any sort of container: Using any of
the methods stated above, we will acquire and input a data set of around 50-100
restaurants, we will be implementing a Classification Tree approach where we will refine
the outcome using the available data.
2. Implement Formulas: Using the concept of Information Gain, we will generate a formula
of Entropy which in layman's terms means that the procedure will help us filter our
irrelevant data and therefore contribute to the Information Gain.

3. Using A Decision Tree: A major starting point in machine learning is regression analysis
where we use binary trees as classification models to predict target outputs from a series
of inputs. We will implement this methodology and break down the datasets we have into
smaller subsets till only the data required is left.



The deliverables of this project will be a restaurant/or a list of restaurants that will
be coherently strained out to match the users' preferences and will make it easier
for the user to decide where to go for his/her meal. It will remove the hassle of
having to scrounge through the plethora of restaurants and their reviews to find
something that suits your tastes and your budget.
